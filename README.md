This is a simple blog on my progress in learning how to program languages mainly Python, JavaScript, and Java.

I am using Codinfox-lanyon as a jekyll temple based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). See a live demo [here](http://codinfox.github.io). Click to get this [template](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon), give him a star if you like it!
