# Memorizing the Hardware

Learning online without taking class can be little daunting at the beginning. Focus on fun facts and everything will be all good. There are `A+ 901 and 902 certifications`, so let's <b>separate</b> these two by starting with this [A+ 901 Study Guide][A+ 901 Study Guide].  PDFs are just to help me understand the study guides better. If need a link to either [PDF 1][PDF 1] and or [PDF 2][PDF 2] that I am using.

I noticed that this [A+ 901 Study Guide][A+ 901 Study Guide] started with BIOS and I am not sure why. I will start with Hardware, and then BIOS afterward.

# Hardware Part 1
- Peripheral Devices
  - Motherboards
  - Connection Interface
  - Display Devices
  - Audio and Multimedia Devices
  - Removable Storage Devices
- System Components
-

The listed above is what we will be cover in this post. I will try my best to slim this post up.
