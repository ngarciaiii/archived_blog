# A+ certifications without taking a course!

I am going to get A+ certifications, both 901 and 902. Do I need to take the class to pass the exam? <b>Let's use the internet first.</b> There are probably better resources online, but I think these links below will do.

Stumbled into these study guides below from [reddit][reddit]. If you don't know what [reddit][reddit] is, it is literally the people of internet sharing information. It might be hard to navigate as a first-timer. Get hang of it and you will find all the information just about <b>anything</b> you need.

- [A+ 902 Study Guide][A+ 902 Study Guide]

Why need a textbook when there are PDFs out online for free? These PDFs below are what I decide to use. Both of these are bit different. <b>Ask me if I am going to read these slowly and carefully... the answer is no</b>. I am going to skim, use my best judgement on where to read carefully.

- [PDF 2][PDF 2]

Lastly, [Exam Compass][Exam Compass] has all kinds of mock exams for IT related certifications. I used it to get an <b>ASTQB certification</b> and it worked. I read the PDFs, meanwhile <b>I just keep failing the mock exams until I passed twice or thrice in row, and then I took the exam first time and passed it with 82% which is somewhat impressive.</b> The mock exam is pretty similar and accurate with the real exam. That is for ASTQB. I am not sure about A+ which is why I am going to be actually reading off PDFs. I will let you know if [Exam Compass][Exam Compass] is accurate again!
