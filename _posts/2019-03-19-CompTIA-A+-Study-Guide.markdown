# Took 30Bird Course on A+

I am going to get A+ certifications, both 901 and 902! I took A+ course under 30Bird. It is a speed course which covers A+ both 901 and 902 for 5 days. There's no distinct line between 901 and 902 in that class. The instructor said there will be two different exams, each for 901 and 902. Each exam will be 90 questions and 90 minutes. He warned that this course does not cover all and his sole goal is to have us pass. I will be using external resources also.

Stumbled into these study guides below from [reddit][reddit]. If you don't know what [reddit][reddit] is, it is literally the people of internet sharing information. It might be hard to navigate as a first-timer. Get hang of it and you will find all the information just about <b>ANYTHING</b> you need.

- [A+ 902 Study Guide][A+ 902 Study Guide]

I noticed that this [A+ 901 Study Guide][A+ 901 Study Guide] started with BIOS and I am not sure why. I will start with Hardware, and then BIOS afterward. I have a 30Bird A+ spiral textbook and I couldn't find a copy in pdf of it. I don't want to scan every page, so just download the CompTIA A+ Comprehensive (220-901/902 powerpoint from [30Bird][30Bird]. 

Lastly, [Exam Compass][Exam Compass] has all kinds of mock exams for IT related certifications. I used it to get an <b>ASTQB certification</b> and it worked. I read the PDFs, meanwhile <b>I just keep failing the mock exams until I passed twice or thrice in row, and then I took the exam first time and passed it with 82% which is somewhat impressive.</b> The mock exam is pretty similar and accurate with the real exam. That is for ASTQB. I am not sure about A+ which is why I am going to be actually reading off PDFs. I will let you know if [Exam Compass][Exam Compass] is accurate again!
