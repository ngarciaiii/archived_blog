# MOOC.fi Week 4 continues!

## Exercise 79 NumberStatistics

This exercise teaches that we could call methods within an object. Objects can call their own methods. In this exercise, we will have two objects `amountOfNumbers` and `sum`. We get to see `sum()` being called from the `average` method.  This exercise wants:

- `addNumber` adds a new number to the statistics
- `amountOfNumbers` tells us how many numbers have been added to the statistics
- `sum` returns the sum of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the sum is 0)
- `average` returns the average of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the average is 0)
- create a program that asks the user to input numbers of type integer
- when gives -1, the program stops and prints the sum of the given numbers (excluding the -1)
- Change it to also calculates the sum of even and odd numbers in the user input (again -1 excluded)

Okay, we will start with non-main class, or <strong>NumberStatistics</strong> class. I will comment everything in the code block.

```java
public class NumberStatistics {                           
    private int amountOfNumber;                     //create object  
    private int sum;                                //create object

    public NumberStatistics() {                 //constructor
        this.amountOfNumber = amountOfNumber;   //initialize object
        this.sum = sum;                         //initialize object
    }

    public void addNumber(int number){          //parameters number given by user
        amountOfNumber++;                       //counts the numbers given by user
        sum += number;                          //sum adds all numbers given by user
    }

    public int amountOfNumbers(){               //returns result of amountOfNumbers++
        return amountOfNumber;
    }

    public int sum(){                           //returns result of sum +=number                 
        return sum;
    }

    public double average(){                    //calculates average
        if (amountOfNumber != 0) {              //if amountOfNumber is not 0
            double average = (1.0 * sum())/amountOfNumber;
            return average;
        } return 0;
    }
}
```

What we have done so far:

- ~~`addNumber` adds a new number to the statistics~~
- ~~`amountOfNumbers` tells us how many numbers have been added to the statistics~~
- ~~`sum` returns the sum of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the sum is 0)~~
- ~~`average` returns the average of the added numbers (if no numbers added, the average is 0)~~

Three remaining tasks require executing, so better to do that in main class.

- create a program that asks the user to input numbers of type integer

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        NumberStatistics stats = new NumberStatistics();
        NumberStatistics even = new NumberStatistics();
        NumberStatistics odd = new NumberStatistics();

        int num = 0;
        System.out.println("Type numbers: ");
```

- when gives -1, the program stops and prints the sum of the given numbers (excluding the -1)

```java

        while (num >= 0){
            num = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
        }

        System.out.println("sum: " + stats.sum());
```

- change it to also calculates the sum of even and odd numbers in the user input (again -1 excluded)

```java
        while (num >= 0){
            num = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
            if (num % 2 == 0 && num >= 0) {
                stats.addNumber(num);
                even.addNumber(num);
            } else if (num % 2 != 0 && num >= 0){
                stats.addNumber(num);
                odd.addNumber(num);
            }
        }

        System.out.println("sum: " + stats.sum());
        System.out.println("sum of even: " + even.sum());
        System.out.println("sum of odd: " + odd.sum());
    }
}
```

This exercise is good practice with having two different class files. Main or executing class file, and non-main class creating objects and methods. I think I am getting there!

# Randomness using Random()

<strong>Exercise 80</strong> to <strong>Exercise 82</strong> teaches on how to use a method `Random()`. It can be little hard to grasp at first. I get confused sometime in the few next exercises.

## Dice

We will start with <strong>Exercise 80</strong>. It is the easiest for us beginners to understand how it works. There are main and non-main classes below. They have skeletons given, and non-main class is incomplete. Only one more line of coding in non-main class needed to complete it:

<div style="-webkit-column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2; width: 750px; height: 400; margin: auto">
  <div style="float: left; width: 372px; height: auto">
      <h2>Main Class</h2>
      <pre style="width: 370px; height: 270px; font-size: 50%">
        <code class="language-java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dice dice = new Dice(6);

        int i = 0;
        while ( i < 10 ) {
            System.out.println( dice.roll() );
            i++;
        }
    }
}
        </code>
      </pre>
  </div>
  <div style="float: right; width: 372px; height: auto; margin-top: .5px">
      <h2>Dice Class</h2>
      <pre style="width: 370px; height: 270px; font-size: 50%">
        <code class="language-java">
import java.util.Random;

public class Dice {
    private Random random;
    private int numberOfSides;

    public Dice(int numberOfSides){
        this.numberOfSides = numberofSides;
        random = new Random();

    }

    public int roll() {
          // we'll get a random number in the range 1-numberOfSides<
    }
}
        </code>
      </pre>
  </div>
</div>

<strong>Main Class</strong> is the executing class, and what's going on in there is a constructor `Dice` creates a object named `dice`. Its parameter is `6` or `Dice(6)`.  `i` is a counter variable and initialized with a `0`. It increments up to 9, or actually 10 times since it starts with 0. Prints what `dice.roll()` produced until `i` reaches to 10 times. Nothing is needed to be added in this Main class.

One line of coding is needed to add to this <strong>Dice Class</strong>. We have an encapsulation of two different private variables `random` and `numberOfSides`. The type of `random` is `Random` which is new to me. The constructor `Dice()`, with `int numberOfSides` as its parameter, initialized both private variables. `random` is assigned as a `Random()`, but what happens is that constructor or object to be made, `Dice()` is now acting as a `Random()`. I assume `numberOfSides` as a parameter is to be the maximum or the highest number possible to be randomized.

`public int roll()` is a method created to randomize a number when being executed. Now this I have a hard time with. Truthfully, I would have never solved it had I not googled up for a solution. There is a new method in Scanner that I have yet to learn and it is `.nextInt()`. I have always been using `.nextLine()` or `Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine)`. So this `.nextInt()` is new to me. Let's see the solution.

```java
public int roll() {
    // create here a random number belongig to range 1-numberOfSided
    return random.nextInt(numberOfSides) + 1;
}
```

So the method `.roll()` is created, and its function is to `return` the number that `random.nextInt(numberOfSides) + 1;` has randomized. Notice how there is a `+ 1`, if I did not include that, then `0` will occur. I don't want a `0`. I try to understand more about `Random()` and [Oracle][Oracle] website will give a documentation to just about every method out there for Java, but it doesn't a great job explaining in laymen term. I think [stackoverflow][stackoverflow] is better and easier to understand. I added `+ 1` as a minimum number.
