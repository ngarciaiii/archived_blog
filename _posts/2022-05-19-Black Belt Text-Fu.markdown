## This is the Advanced Text-Fu section from [Linux Journey][Linux Journey]

## Regex (Regular expression)
Regular expression is a tool that uses special notations as an universal language with almost any programming language. I would guess that it is like uh... a stone age retrocomputer's version of Sanskirt or Hebrew language which might be why it's so universal. Actually not this old, more like Greek or Latin language.
