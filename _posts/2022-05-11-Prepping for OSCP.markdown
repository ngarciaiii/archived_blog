# Goodbye QA tester career, Hello Pen tester career!

I was software QA tester for 4 years, I enjoyed working with my co workers and my team. They are great people however the work itself can be monotonous. Find myself often gazing out the window, pondering what I could have been. Eventually I got laid off with everybody else due to contract expiration and another company won the bid. Now here I contemplate on what career I should venture into.


# Penetration tester

A guy who is currently my mentor encouraged to try pen testing and I like it so far! Learning to do some "black hat" hacking on [HackTheBox][HackTheBox] and using brute-forcing was exciting, but mentor said to hold the horse!

>  you can't do brute force anywhere in the world professionally so don't spend too much time on it. Criminal hackers <br>can brute force, but for work or bug bounties <br>brute force is not allowed.

Quote unquote, and he then said **"OSCP is the gold standard"**. Also that I'll have to take PEN 200 course to pass the exam. He suggested on taking PEN 100 course first. Well grab something to brace on and take a look below.

**Did you see that?! 699 + 1499 = $2,198** I am pretty sure I could do without PEN 100 and found this gem [abatchy.com][abatchy.com]. It got a cute avatar showing llamma or alpaca, probably the latter. Meanwhile following abatchy's guide, I have been researching on successful pen testers/hackers in the world. Most of them are proficient in Python. I programmed in python over 10 years ago and it was for a year long before dived into JavaScript and Java. I need to pick up and restore my old forgotten skills. [Automate The Boring Stuff][Automate] seems like a great free way to relearn Python.

# Now what?
 
This is embarrassing as you can see I posted once every two year since 2019. This ends now. I am going to be dedicated in blogging on my learning progress. OSCP exam is the ultimate boss to face. I will be dabbling HTB while learning from abatchy's guide, until I am ready to upgrade to [Offensive Security's Proving Grounds][PG Practice]. Cheers!
