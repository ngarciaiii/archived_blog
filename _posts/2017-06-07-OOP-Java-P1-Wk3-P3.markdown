# The ArrayList Data Structure

From <strong>Exercise #61</strong> to <strong>Exercise #69</strong> focus on `ArrayList<Integer>()`. I am going to start with <strong>Exercise #64</strong> which covers on how to use `(ArrayList<Integer> list)`. Recall the <strong>Exercise #46 Average of Given Numbers</strong> which covers on parameter `(in num1, int num2, int num3, ...)`, almost the same idea, but using array `list` instead.

# Average Of Numbers

```java
public class AverageOfNumbers {

    public static int sum(ArrayList<Integer> list){
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num :list){
                sum += num;
        } return sum;
    }
```

Creating a method `sum`, and using `for (int num : list)` to go through with each element in the array. In pervious exercises, we use `for(type element : array)` frequently. It is very useful. In this method, it returns the value of `sum`. This is a method that doesn't hold a value right now, but it does return a value when applied.

```java
    public static double average(ArrayList<Integer> list){
        int i = 0;
        for (int num : list){
                i++;
        }
        double average = 1.0 * sum(list) / i;
        return average;
    }    
```

Another method called `average` is used to calculate an average on the array, using also a value from method `sum`.


```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        list.add(3);
        list.add(2);
        list.add(7);
        list.add(2);

        System.out.println("The average is: " + average(list));
    }
}
```

Two methods `sum` and `average` are called in the `main` method to execute. Numbers are added to the array `list`. Now `sum` has a value, and so do the `average`.

# The Variance

Skipping <strong>Exercise #65 and #66</strong> because both are same as above, teaching us how to use `for (type element : array)` and using basic algorithms again. This <strong>Exercise #67</strong> might be worth to note, I faced a problem with [NetBeans][NetBeans], although I got the right result. It was meticulous and I realized what I did wrong.

```java
public class Variance {
    public static int sum(ArrayList<Integer> list){
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : list) {
                sum += num;
        } return sum;
    }

    public static double average(ArrayList<Integer> list){
        int i = 0;
        for(int num : list){
                i++;
        }
        double average = (1.0 * sum(list)) / i;
        return average;
    }
```

Same methods borrowed from <strong>Exercise #64</strong> above. Don't worry about these... other than that they hold the values of `sum` and `average`. Let's see if you could spot a mistake in this coding below:

```java
public static double variance(ArrayList<Integer> list){
  double result = 0;
  double sum = 0;

  for (int num : list) {
    result = Math.pow((num - average(list)), 2);
    sum += result;
  }

  double variance = (sum / (list.size()-1));
  return variance;
}
```

Could you find it? Let's take a look at the coding below that is correct and compare to identify what went wrong with the coding above.

```java
    public static double variance(ArrayList<Integer> list){
        double result = 0;
        double sum = 0;
        double average = average(list);

        for (int num : list) {
                result = Math.pow((num - average), 2);
                sum += result;
        }

        double variance = (sum / (list.size()-1));
        return variance;
    }
```

Yep! What happened was in the wrong coding, the `average` method is being called repeatedly for each element in the array. It reaches same result, same correct answer but cost the computer more energy and memory even.

In the right coding, `average` method value is assigned to `average`, so that way `average` method wouldn't have to calculate repeatedly.

```java
// Wrong coding
for (int num : list) {
  result = Math.pow((num - average(list)), 2);
  sum += result;
}

// Correct coding
double average = average(list);

for (int num : list) {
        result = Math.pow((num - average), 2);
        sum += result;
}
```

# More Than Once

This exercise teaches how to use `boolean` method. What's mandate in `boolean` method is to return a value of either `true`, or `false`.

```java
public static boolean moreThanOnce(ArrayList<Integer> list, int searched) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int number : list) {
        if (number == searched){
            total++;
        }
    }

    if (total > 1) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
   Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
   ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
   list.add(3);
   list.add(2);
   list.add(7);
   list.add(2);

   System.out.println("Type a number: ");
   int number = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());
   if (moreThanOnce(list, number)) {
       System.out.println(number + " appears more than once.");
   } else {
       System.out.println(number + " does not appear more than once. ");
   }
}
```

`moreThanOnce` method will automatically tell `main` method what's `true` or `false` when it is being called.

# Palindromi

I believe it is spelled Palindrome, but Palindromi is in Finnish's language. This is the last exercise of week 3. I think this is easy, thanks to earlier basic algorithm <strong>Exercise #56</strong> on <strong>ReversingText</strong>. This <strong>Exercise #69</strong> asks for either `true` or `false`. Let's do a `boolean` method.

```java
public static boolean palindrome(String text) {

   String reversed = "";
   for (int i = text.length() -1; i > -1; i--) {
       char letter = text.charAt(i);
       reversed = reversed + letter;
   }

   if (text.equals(reversed)) {
       return true;
   } return false;
}
```
