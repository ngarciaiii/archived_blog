## Took 30Bird Course in class

I was to take a course under 30Bird by a company where I work at. It is a speed course which covers A+ both 901 and 902 for 5 days. There's no distinct line between 901 and 902 in that class. The instructor said there will be two different exams, each for 901 and 902. Each exam will be 90 questions and 90 minutes. I will continue on using [A+ 901 Study Guide][A+ 901 Study Guide].

I noticed that this [A+ 901 Study Guide][A+ 901 Study Guide] started with BIOS and I am not sure why. I will start with Hardware, and then BIOS afterward.

# Hardware Part 1

I ordered all parts and built my PC. I remember that the first thing I looked to buy was a `computer case`, `enclosure`, or some people would say `Desktop PC Tower`. It encases as a protector of all parts together. There are different sizes depending on the size of motherboard and CPU cooler. The sizes are not limited to as displayed in the figure below.

Full and or mid towers are the most common because people intend to get ATX motherboard. Notice XL-ATX, ATX, EATX, mATX, ITX, and Mini-ITX listed under towers in the image, these are just names of motherboard designs which are known as `form factors` that have their own specifications like the <b> dimensions, power supply type, locations of mounting holes, number of ports on the back panel, etc</b>. Nevermind the "bays" listed, they are what hold disk drives.

`Motherboard` is one of the most important hardwares. It serves as a backbone for entire computer system which is why some people call it a `system board`. <b>FUN FACT:</b> Apple call it `logic board`. PC builders would call it `mobo` for short. Mobo has some components soldered in, and some sockets/slots ready to be pinned in. Components will be detailed after the image of sizes of motherboards below. Take a closer look on a mobo below.

## CPU

I will assume that the most important component on the motherboard is CPU.
