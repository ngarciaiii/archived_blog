# Continuing OOP Java Week 3

In last week, we learned how to use methods and calling arguments from a method into another method. <strong>Exercise #47</strong> to <strong>Exercise #60</strong> focuses on how to manipulate a string or text using methods.

I am going to be concise. <strong>Exercise #47</strong> asks to find how many characters are there in a name. <strong>Exercise #48</strong> wants to identify what the first character's element. <strong>Exercise #49</strong> wants to find the element of the last character.


```java
// Finding the length of a name (counting how many characters)
int length = name.length();

// Identifying the element of the first character
char letter = name.charAt(0);

// Identifying the element of the last character
char letter = name.charAt(name.length()-1);
}
```  

I would like to review the <strong>Exercise #49</strong>, identifying the element of the last character. Supposedly the name is "Harry", and `name.length()` found 5 characters (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Let's translate `name.charAt(name.length()-1)` into numeric => `name.charAt(5 - 1)` => `name.charAt(4)`. So if I want to find the last character of "Harry", then I look for `.charAt(4)` and it's the fifth character.

## Reversing Name

Jumping to <strong>Exercise #52</strong>, I usually use `for` loop, but [MOOC][MOOC] solutions often use `while` loop. To be honest, `while` loops often make more sense for these kind of problems than `for` loop. Let's see the difference.

`for` loop solution:

```java
for (int i = name.length() - 1; i > -1; i--) {
    char letter = name.charAt(i);
    System.out.print(letter);
} System.out.println("");
```

`while` loop solution:

```java
int i = name.length() - 1;
while (i >= 0) {
   System.out.print(name.charAt(i));
   i--;
} System.out.println("");
```

I prefer `for` loop this time.

## First Part & The End part

If I want to extract letters in the first part of the word, I could use this method `.substring()` from `String` class. It's similar to JavaScript's `.slice()`.

```java
System.out.print("Type a word: ");
String word = reader.nextLine();

System.out.print("Length of the first part: ");
int i = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

System.out.println("Result: " + word.substring(0, i));

// Type a word: cartwheel
// Length of the first part: 3
// Result: car
```
See how that works? `.substring(beginning, ending)`, sometime can do just `.substring(beginning)`, taking the first part off. Let's extract letters from the end part of the word. This time, its a little trickier.

```java
System.out.print("Type a word: ");
String word = reader.nextLine();

System.out.print("Length of the end part: ");
int i = Integer.parseInt(reader.nextLine());

int j = word.length() - i;

System.out.println("Result: " + word.substring(j));

// Type a word: example
// Length of the end part: 4
// Result: mple
```

Notice how there is a `j`. It had to be done, because if I used `.substring(i)`, I wouldn't be able to get the end part that I want without doing any math. Let's do the math with `j`!

- want 4 characters at end of the word i.e. `mple`
- if `.substring(4)`, will return `ple`
- `word.length()` = 7
- 7 - 4 = 3
- `word.length() - i` => `word.length() - 4` => `3 = j` => `word.substring(j)`

Might be little hard to get mind around to it at first.

# All About Words

Skimming through from <strong>Exercise #55</strong> to <strong>Exercise #60</strong>, same basic algorithms, different syntax in Java. I am going to cover all String's methods.

## .indexOf()

```java
// word1 = glitter
//word2 = litter

int index = word1.indexOf(word2);
if (index == -1) {
   System.out.println("The word '" + word2 + "' is not found in the word '" + word1 + "'.");
} else {
   System.out.println("The word '" + word2 + "' is found in the word '" + word1 + "'.");
}
```

`.indexOf()` finds the index of an element in an element. If `indexOf()` cannot find the element in an element, then it will return `-1`. In this case, `word2` is found in `word1`!

## .contains()

```java
//Using while(true) loop

if (words.contains(word)){
    System.out.println("You gave the word " + word + " twice");
    break;
} else {
    words.add(word);
}
```

Coding above covers `.contains()`, and what it does is like `indexOf()`. There was a debate on whether's faster.`.contains()` seems to be faster but it's just more convenient. `.indexOf()` is faster and is also implemented in `.contains()`.  

## Other string methods

```java
// often used as a boolean purpose, seeing whether word or input is empty
word.isEmpty();

// reverses the array
Collections.reverse(words)

// sorts the array in alphabetic order
Collections.sort(words)
```

Will need to do `import java.util.Collections;` to use `.reverse()` and `.sort()`
