  Hi! I am Nicolas Garcia, a Washington D.C. based web developer and programmer. Junior level at this moment, hey I am still young!
</p>

In this blog, I will be putting down everything that I learned relating to programming and web development. All things I encounter.

 * Tricks
 * Shortcuts
 * Problems/Obstacles
 * Solutions

 And even those that I stumbled into that got me stumped. Oh I hope to find some unsolved issues, and then I can run over to [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)!

There are currently three languages I am focusing on:

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)
* [Java](https://go.java)

Follow me on this blog or on my github and see what I learned! I will be using Freecodecamp and few other online courses!  [GitHub](https://github.com/ngarciaiii).
